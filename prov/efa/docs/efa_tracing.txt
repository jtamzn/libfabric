QUICK INSTRUCTION ABOUT TRACING (DEVELOPMENT)

1. Install lttng according to doc here: https://lttng.org/docs/v2.13/#doc-building-from-source. A couple of notes
    - Install to a shared location like /fsx
    - Use --disable-numa if you'd like to skip numactl
    - Install URCU and LTTNG in same prefix. After install URCU, export PKG_CONFIG_PATH to include its .pc before building LTTNG

2. Build libfabric with LTTNG using --with-lttng=<lttng_prefix>.
    - This branch will enforce including lttng with a macro of #error, this is temporary to ensure we're indeed tracing
    - The macro is INCLUDE_LTTNG
    
3. Build fabtests as normal.
